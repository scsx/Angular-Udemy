Hi I'm taking an Angular course and once again can't download the resources needed for an assignment. This time here:

https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/practice/274/#questions
Since the UI changed, for much worse may I add, I can't download resources and so I can't practice the subjects, making the course an experience of simple copy/paste. Thank you

Hi Jorge
thank you for reaching out!
Jorge
Hi Israel. Thanks
Was my description clear?
Following that link I choose "Skip assignment"
Israel Martinez
yes, let me open the course on my end
Jorge
Sorry, "Start assignment"
Than when clicking "Available resource" takes me back to the beggining
Israel Martinez
If there are downloadable supplementary materials in a course, open the left menu to access resources and browse course content.

This article also shows how you can access the resources.

I've tried to download a supplementary material of this course and it let me do it
Jorge
What left menu? The one with "    Course content
    Overview
    Q&A
    Bookmarks
    Announcements"
?
Israel Martinez
on the left, you should see the course curriculum
Jorge
I never see it on the left. I can see it on the right or bottom, depending if I have the video maximized
Israel Martinez
sorry
on the right
Jorge
It's fine
Israel Martinez
you should see the course curriculum
Jorge
the thing is that there, the assignments don't have attachments
for instance the next lecture, 108. [OPTIONAL] Assignment Solution, has attachment, with folder icon and download
But that's the solution, there's nothing left for me to do
The assignment called "Assignment: Practicing Services" should provide a code that I should work and then submit for evaluation. I can't access that code

Unfortunately, to resolve this problem it will require the escalations team’s expertise. I will escalate your ticket to them for further research and they will follow up with you via email.
Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
